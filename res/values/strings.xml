If you still need to add your own prefix at the beginning, you can use %ALL%_ and _%ALL% (Example: chelpus.%ALL%_com.android._%ALL%.txt). When displaying custom patch names in the program itself, %ALL%_ is hidden for readability."</string>
    <string name="help_custom_general_text4" formatted="false">- In the text of a custom patch, you can use %PACKAGE_NAME%, which will be substituted with the package name of the target application during the patch.

    <string name="help_custom_general_text6">- If you want to patch dalvik-cache or odex, do not forget that the bytes of data in different firmware versions may vary. In early versions of android before the introduction of ART, you could patch dalvik cache or odex files, but there you need to take into account that the bytes of the opcodes do not always match the bytes in classes.dex, so when writing such a patch, you need to look at this place by opening the file in IDA Pro.</string>
    <string name="help_custom_general_text7">- Starting with version 6.5.4+, Lucky Patcher has the ability to create files with the lpzip extension. These are zip archives that can contain custom patches and apk files.

    <string name="help_custom_group_param">Marks patterns of the group (group number could be 1 or higher). You may be asking \"What does this mean?\". Well, what it means is that If at least one pattern from the group has succeeded, the user will be shown a dialog that the patch has completed successfully.

    <string name="help_custom_insert_param">"Is used in cases where it is necessary to replace the found original with a number of bytes different from the number of bytes of the original pattern. Most often this is needed in various text files. For example, when the xml file contains: \"lives=9\", but you need to replace it with \"lives=999\", in this case, insert will help, without changing the data after \"lives=9\".
(Example: before the patch, the file contains: \"chelpa end\")"</string>

Names and parameters are written in smali syntax. If you use the \"original\" and \"replaced\" templates after these parameters, then the search will take place inside the method. If only the \"replaced\" template is used, then the entire method code will be replaced with this template and zeros without searching, but in this case the size of the template must be less than or equal to the size of the method code.</string>
    <string name="help_custom_name_param">"Usually indicates the object to which the patch will be applied. It can be just a file name, a file name with a path, and the like. In some cases, you can use '*' to patch all libraries, for example if the name of the library is unknown."</string>
    <string name="help_custom_odex_patch_tag">"There are situations when you need to change an already patched application, for example, for which the license check has already been removed by an automatic patch, then this tag comes to the rescue. All \"original\"-\"replaced\" patterns after it will be applied to the odex file that other patches have already created. For example, this was required for the first time in Final Fantasy III, when people treated the game with Extreme License Check Removal Mode, but in order for the translation to be displayed in the correct encoding, additional patches in the odex file were required, which became possible to apply using this tag. If we use a simple [PACKAGE]-[CLASSES], [ODEX] or [CLASSES]-[ODEX], odex-file will be created with no change and only then patched. In this version of Lucky Patcher, this is no longer required, since there is an option \"%1$s\".
Example:"</string>
    <string name="help_custom_odex_tags">On older Androids, this tag could be used. Instead of the tag [CLASSES], you can use this one. Then the changes in classes.dex will be saved not in dalvik-cache, where they periodically disappear when the system updates the cache, but in a separate file with the odex extension next to the apk of the application, which will fix all the changes and leave the original dalvik-cache intact - this is just in case, if the application checks it. You can use [ODEX] after [CLASSES], then the changes will be made to the dalvik cache and automatically committed to odex. This is not necessary on modern firmware.</string>

    <string name="help_custom_package_tag_detail">This tag means that we will not patch dalvik-cache directly, but we will pull out classes.dex from target application, patch it (with patches that follow the identifiers [CLASSES] or [ODEX]), create an odex image with changes and put into application. This is the image that TitaniumBuckup needs, for example. It checks it and all check-sums inside it must be correct. It is advisable to always use this tag, because such a patch is the most correct, but if it causes any problems, you can do without it.</string>

For example, there is a variable: const/4 v?,0x00. The question mark shows, that var's number is unknown (for example, after it has been changed in the newer version), but you are sure, that this var equals 0, and you want to set it to 1. In this case pattern will look like this:"</string>

Attention! You *CANNOT* download paid applications for free!
1. You can use GoogleLVL-protected applications without having to crack them.
2. License verification will succeed even while being offline.
3. There is no need to apply license patches any more.
4. It will not work with Billing and License Verification via Proxy.
5. Now when you press the 'Refund' button, it will refund your purchase, but the application will not be uninstalled, therefore you won't need to backup the application prior to requesting a refund.
6. Now Google Play will redirect all purchases to Lucky Patcher for emulating InApp."</string>
